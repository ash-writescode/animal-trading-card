## A portfolio project as part of the Udacity front end development nanodegree program. This project is complete.

## Udacity Project Animal Trading Card Task Instructions
Again, your job is to reproduce the styling you see in the design prototype (shown below), while customizing the card with your own animal image and text.

### 1. Look Over the Design Prototype
The first thing you should do is simply spend a few minutes having a close look over the design prototype (above) to consider what styling you'll need to apply.

### 2. Customize the Card Content
Before you add the styling, you'll first want to customize the starter page with your own content about an animal of your choosing.

For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted.

### 3. Link the Style Sheet and Add Class Attributes
For this project, the goal is to fully separate all of the style information from the HTML. In other words, we do not want to put any CSS in the HTML file—instead, all of the CSS will go in styles.css

To set that up, you'll need to first add a few things to the HTML in card.html
Use a link element to link your stylesheet. 
Add class attributes to the HTML elements you want to style.
Make sure you use meaningful names for you css classes.

### 4.Add Your CSS
Now it is time to add the CSS that will provide the style seen in the design prototype.

Here are some pointers:
The image should have a width of 300px. If the image itself is not 300px, you'll need to set this in your css.
The card's width should be fixed.
Since the image is 300px wide, the entire catd's width should be 300px + spacing on either side.
The text for the animal's interesting fact is in italics.
The labels for each of the animal's list items should be in bold.
Notice in the prototype there are no dots (bullet points) for the list items.
There should be borders around the animal's name, image, and text information. Make sure you set the border-style, border-width, and border-color.
There should be spacing (padding) around the animal's name, image, the list of items, and the information.

### 5. Standout Suggestions (Optional)
To take your submission to the next level, you can add additional customizations to your card. As long as you include all of the above, you're welcome (and encouraged) to play with the styles and adjust the design.

For inspiration, here are some ideas:

Change the background colors or border-radius.
Add a box shadow on the entire card.
If you really want to challenge yourself, you could try creating multiple cards that are all displayed on the same page—and you could even use flexbox to adjust how they get displayed when the page is resized.

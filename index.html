	  <p>Giraffe spots are their unique identifier, like fingerprints are for humans. No two giraffes have the same spots. They are herbivores  (plant eaters) and consume about 4kg of leaves and twigs per day. In the wild they can live for about 25 years. They usually roam in a group known as a tower that has around 15 giraffes led by an adult male giraffe.</p>
